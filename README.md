# PCCFplus-with-R
Workflow for using the Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+) with R. Currently developed to be used with PCCF+ 7E.

**Statistics Canada and Canada Post are the owners of the copyright in the PCCF+.** This repository does not provide or reconstruct the PCCF+, nor does it circumvent the need to obtain a copy and a license of the PCCF+. Use of code in this repository requires that you have already obtained access to the PCCF+ (e.g. [via the Community Data Program](https://communitydata.ca/content/postal-code-conversion-file-plus-pccf-version-7e-november-2021)).

## Usage
This repository uses the [`renv` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for isolation and reproducibility. Launching the R project (via `PCCFplus-with-R.Rproj`) will automatically download a compatible version of `renv` if not already present, and build the project-local library. This is highly recommended, but not required. Alternatively, you can run the scripts using your main R library without `renv`, understanding that manual installation of missing packages will be required and that mismatched package versions could result in errors.

A description follows of the two main scripts in this repository:
1. [`text_to_csv.R`](#text_to_csvr)
2. [`region_subset.R`](#region_subsetr)

## 1. `text_to_csv.R`
Converts the PCCF+'s ASCII data files (must be provided by user in `data/txt` directory) to a friendlier CSV format (will output to `data/csv` directory).

This code is programmatically generated by `meta/meta.R`, utilizing the data dictionaries from the PCCF+ manual (`meta/data_dictionary.R`). Since the output of `meta/meta.R` is already provided (`text_to_csv.R`), code in the `meta` directory does not need to be executed by the typical user unless changes to code generation are desired.

## 2. `regional_subset.R`
To use this script, you must have already populated the the `data/csv` directory by executing [`text_to_csv.R`](#text_to_csvr).

For a region of interest (indicated as a vector of dissemination area IDs near the top of the file), `regional_subset.R` will generate a weighted many-to-many relationship table that can be used for dissemination area weighted assignment of 6, 5, 4, or 3 character *residential* postal codes (output to `data/PCCF+ 7E regional subset.csv`). When performing analyses, these weights can be used directly, or a single dissemination area can be selected probabilistically for a postal code record (this functionality not provided in this repository and has special record management considerations).

**Note that when using the output of this script you will not get warnings or quality indicators like you would when using the PCCF+ product. Use at your own risk.**

## Contributing
Contributions and improvements are welcome! This can range from minor (e.g. project dependency updates, documentation, code comments) to more substantial bugfixes or feature additions (e.g. support for institutional postal codes, warnings, or  quality indicators).
