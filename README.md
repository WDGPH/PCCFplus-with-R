# PCCFplus-with-R
Workflow for using the Postal Code Conversion File Plus (PCCF+) with R

# PCCF_text_to_csv.R
Code to convert the PCCF+'s ASCII data files (from `data/txt` folder) to a friendlier CSV format (output to `data/csv` folder).

This code is programmatically generated by `meta/meta.R`, utilizing the data dictionaries from the PCCF+ manual (`meta/data_dictionary.R`). Since the output of `meta/meta.R` is already provided (`PCCF_text_to_csv.R`), code in the `meta` folder does not need to be executed by the typical user unless changes to code generation are desired.
